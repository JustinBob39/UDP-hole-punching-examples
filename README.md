# UDP Hole Punching Examples

A small collection of example programs to show how UDP hole punching
can be done. Hole punching is a mechanism to access computers in
private networks behind NAT (Network Address Translation).

This is a key principle behind [STUN](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt).
Also important concepts are the different NAT types:

* Full Cone NAT (normal)
* Restricted Cone NAT
* Port Restricted NAT

The examples have not been successfully tested and are probably broken!

Pull requests are welcome. :-)
